# Meatadata

Meatadata is, in short, a continuously scrolling log of your life. It's not picky or naggy. It tries to write down your current thoughts, feelings, and To-do's as quickly as possible.
Quickly might mean messy. And messy might mean you have to clean it up later. But that's a good thing. 

# Why?

### **I'm an *ideas* guy, maaaan. I think big picture. I just need you to turn my ideas into an app.**
###### *- some sales douche, probably.*

I love ideas - but they're given a bad wrap in the engineering world because of the relative importance people put on them vs. implementation. 

Most ideas stay in "idea" form forever, and it takes discipline and wherewhithall ~~to make them a reality.~~

But ideas are fun. Fun to think about, fun to dream about when you don't quite have the brainpower to think critically and get things done, and fun to polish up in your mind when you have nothing else to do. Like, say, sleep.

Ideas are so much fun, it turns out, that they contribute to my insomnia. I spend a lot of time sort of "whittling" an idea down in my head, resolving it, imagining what it would be like.
All day, but particularly when it gets later at night, I start to worry that I'll forget some aspect or philosophy of an idea if I fall asleep, and that's enough to keep me running it over and over in my head.
And I looooove sleep.

Most of these are nonesense, but even still, I'd find myself checking my grammar constantly, pausing to collect my thoughts in a way that *seemed* sane. Reorganizing paragraphs or bullet points so some unknown reader could stand a chance of understanding the madness on the page.

Stories are the same way. I love to talk in general (as many people know, haha), but I also love telling these elaborate stories about my life - usually involving situations anyone with common sense would never get themselves into.
But during the day, and especially at the end, I worry about losing aspects of the story, or the story entirely, or a new way I thought up of telling it that would make it even better.
Again, 

I have insomnia, but not all the time. But when I have it, I'm a zombie that among other personality quirks that are less-than-desirable and negatively impact my life.
I but I don't *always* have insomnia, and I don't *always* feel like hermiting in my apartment, focusing on some project rather than 
It doesn't render me incapable of doing things, and I try not to bitch about it too much, but I felt like there *had* to be a non-chemical fix to this problem.
