# Meatadata

Meatadata is, in short, a continuously scrolling log of your life. It's not picky or naggy. It tries to write down your current thoughts, feelings, and To-do's as quickly as possible.
Quickly might mean messy. And messy might mean you have to clean it up later. But that's a good thing. 

# Why?

### **I'm an *ideas* guy, maaaan. I think big picture. I just need you to turn my ideas into an app.**
###### *- some sales douche, probably.*

I love ideas, but they're given a bad rap in the engineering world. Ideas are exciting, but implemention is *work*. And it's work that turns those ideas into reality. Most ideas don't make it through the birthing process, and end up spending their existence incorporeal, haunting their creators with dim memories of a once-cherished dream.

But ideas are fun. Fun to think about, fun to dream about when you don't quite have the brainpower to think about more important things or get things done. Fun to turn over in your mind when you have nothing else to do. Like, say, sleep.

Ideas are so much fun they contribute to my insomnia. I spend a lot of time sort of "whittling" an idea down in my head, resolving it, imagining what it would be like.
All day, but particularly when it gets later at night, I start to worry that I'll forget some aspect or philosophy of an idea if I fall asleep, and that's enough to keep me running it over and over in my head, keeping me awake.

And I looooove sleep.

Most of my ideas are nonesense, but even still, the rare times I would write them down, I'd be bogged down by trying to organize fractions of half-finished thoughts into a narrative that stood a chance of ever making sense to anybody. Rearranging the structure and wording of sentences only I would see.

Even worse, almost every time the muse strikes, it happens in the middle of doing something else. Opening up a notebook or input-heavy app to write coherent sentences is usually *far* to distracting justify interrupting whatever your doing - especially the more input-heavy quantified self apps.

The same pattern occured when thinking about something interesting that happened today, and how it could make a good story. Or when I thought of long-term, repeatable goals (like stop looking like a hobo and shave every 3 days).

Even simple things, like *Why do I feel so bad right now? Am I having a caffeine crash? How long ago did I drink my last cup of coffee?* were questions that would occupy my thoughts and interrupt me from whatever (obviously very important) thing I was doing before.
